        <h1>About Me :</h1>
        <p> Hi! I'm Prapthi.
            I like sketching using charcoal,pencil,ink sometimes color . 
            Most of my work right now is based on reference images/photos , drawn as a part of my practice and exploration.
            This site is a space to share what I'm working on and how I'm growing.
            I have only uploaded a handful of pieces for now , but I intend to keep adding more as I go along.
            I hope you enjoy my work and find something that resonates with you. </p>
